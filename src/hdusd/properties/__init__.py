""" property classes should be self contained.  They may include:
    PropertyGroup class
        with properties that can be attached to a blender ID type
        methods for syncing these properties
    And panel classes for displaying these properties

    The idea here is to keep all the properties syncing, data, display etc in one place.
    Basically a "model/view" type pattern where we bring them together for ease of maintenance.
    Slightly inspired by vue.js
